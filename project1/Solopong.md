My project is just a very basic solo ping pong game with yourself. I wanted to do something like this so I can know 
all the scripts that would entail a ball hitting a wall and bounce back. I was glad I got that script right for future games 
beause I would like to make ball games sp it was good to get those scripts right. It's not perfect but I'm glad it's interactive 
enough where you can play it.
