My idea for the upcoming Unity project is to give people an idea of how many lives were lost because of decisions made 
by our leaders over time. I want to take a hand full of leaders from the ancient world up until modern day. I will choose
wars and battles that we may or may not have heard of in school but that were definitely signifigent. The way I want to 
demonstrate this is have a rising figure in the backround to show the hierarchy of the leader and then figures beneth.
I will have the figures beneath fall randomly and as each scene passes its will show the numbers of lives lost.
