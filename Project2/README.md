 
In this project we used projection mapping to out a unity scene on three boxes. Each of the boxes interacted with one another where balolos youched the sides of each box. We also incorporated a rubus goldberg in the second box as one of the interactions. The boxes were blue, yellow, and green. The balls can also overflow into eachother.
