The founder is a game about starting your own company and it allow you to think of all aspects that comes with that responsibility.
I named my corporation Kate Korp and I made my Company about making new gadgets. They start you off by giving you a product and they make you try
to build revinue. It also allows you to also seehow you have to get rid of competetors for your product to stand out.

The part of the game I really enjoyed was when you have to hire people. It makes you really think of yourself running a company and where to hire
people and the detail in this game is so good. It even goes down to how you negotiate peoples salary so I really enjoyed playing it and I would
play again.
